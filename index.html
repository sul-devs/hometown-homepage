          I love San Francisco and Brighton has something of San Francisco about
          it. It's by the sea, there's a big gay community, a feeling of people
          being there because they enjoy their life there.

          I feel more comfortable in a place like Brighton - a town, with one
          centre, one bus station, one train station. And there are so many
          arty, creative people, and things are less rushed, less stressed.
